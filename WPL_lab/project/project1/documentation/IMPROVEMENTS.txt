# Suggested Improvements

## 1. Security Enhancements
- **CSRF Protection**: Add Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to all forms (`POST` requests) to prevent unauthorized actions.
- **Input Sanitization**: Ensure all specific user inputs are sanitized using `htmlspecialchars()` before outputting to HTML to prevent XSS attacks. (Already partially implemented).
- **Generic Error Messages**: In production, avoid showing raw database errors (`die($conn->error)`). Log them to a file instead.

## 2. Architecture & Code Quality
- **MVC Pattern**: Refactor the code into a proper Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure. This would separate business logic (PHP) from presentation (HTML).
- **Autoloading**: Use Composer PSR-4 autoloading for classes instead of manual `require` statements.
- **Environment Variables**: Store database credentials in a `.env` file instead of `dbconfig.php` to prevent checking secrets into version control.

## 3. User Experience (UI/UX)
- **Unified Dashboard**: Create a more dynamic dashboard that adapts using a single template rather than separate folders, or keep strict separation but share more components.
- **AJAX Interactions**: Use AJAX for forms (like "Create User") to provide instant feedback without reloading the page.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure all tables and layouts stack correctly on mobile devices (using Bootstrap classes).

## 4. Feature Additions
- **Password Reset**: Implement a "Forgot Password" flow using email tokens.
- **Audit Logs**: Create a table to log important actions (who deleted a user, who changed a grade) for accountability.
- ** Bulk Actions**: Allow admins to upload CSV files to bulk-create students or courses.

## 5. Performance
- **Database Indexing**: Ensure columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses are indexed (currently mostly covered by Foreign Keys, but check `status` columns).
- **Asset Optimization**: Minify CSS and JS files for faster load times.

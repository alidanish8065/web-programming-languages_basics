# Project Documentation: University LMS

## Overview
This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) designed for a university environment. It manages various user roles (Students, Faculty, Admin) and core academic functionalities like Course Management, Enrollment, and Grading.

## Database Structure
The system is built on a MySQL database `LMS` with the following key components:

### User Management
- **users**: Central table for all users (stores login credentials `user_code`, `email`, `password_hash`).
- **roles**: Defines available roles (student, faculty, admin, etc.).
- **user_roles**: Links users to roles (Many-to-Many).
- **student**: Extended profile for students (linked to `users.id`), stores `program_id`, `student_number`.
- **teacher**: Extended profile for faculty (linked to `users.id`), stores `department_id`, `employee_number`.

### Academic Structure
- **department**: Academic departments (e.g., Computer Science).
- **program**: Degree programs (e.g., BSCS, BSIT).
- **course**: Course catalog.
- **course_offering**: Specific instances of courses offered in a semester.
- **enrollment**: Student course registrations.

## Codebase Structure
The project follows a procedural PHP structure with some organization into folders:

- **public/**: Public-facing files.
    - `dbconfig.php`: Database connection settings.
    - `login.php`: Main authentication logic.
    - `adminaccess.php`: Tool to create the first admin account.
- **roles/**: Dashboard and logic for different user roles.
    - `student/`: Student-specific pages (`dashboard.php`).
    - `faculty/`: Faculty-specific pages (Currently Missing).
    - `admin/`: Admin-specific pages (`dashboard.php`).
- **admin_tools/**: Utilities for administrators.
    - `User/`: User management (Create, Edit, List, Delete).
- **templates/**: Shared layout files (Navbar, Footer, Master Base).

## Current Status (Analysis)
- **Database Compatibility**: The database schema is robust and normalized.
- **Authentication**: `login.php` correctly joins `users` and `roles` tables to authenticate.
- **Missing Components**: 
    - The `roles/Faculty` directory does not exist.
    - `roles/Student/dashboard.php` contains hardcoded/placeholder data.
    - `roles/admin/dashboard.php` needs updates to display relevant admin statistics.

## Setup Instructions
1. Import `LMS DATABASE.txt` into your MySQL database.
2. Configure `public/dbconfig.php` with your database credentials.
3. Use `public/adminaccess.php` to create your initial Super Admin or Admin account.
4. Login via `public/login.html`.
